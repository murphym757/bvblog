# bvblog
When I initially created the *Bayside Vinyl* brand, the goal was to create something that was more than physical presence. I wanted to combine my love for music, as well as, programming. It started with simply a website.This website serves as a general overview of Bayside Vinyl, but more importantly, what the brand could eventually become. The plan was to create a blog and a neat program that allows users to search for music based on what various aspects. While the program is still in the early stages of development, the blog is officially complete. The plan was to create both projects via Ruby on Rails, but that changed once I felt comfortable in my abilities with RoR. JavaScript (specifically the MEAN Stack) is what these projects will be built with.

Using elements of the MEAN Stack, *BV Blog* was created to provide a community of like-minded music lovers a place to post their favorite songs at the moment.

*A Restful API (using Node and Express) to serve as the backbone of the app itself.

*MongooseJS was used to connect Node to MongoDB.

*Heroku serves as the host for the app.

*Bootstrap, HTML 5 & CSS3 (along with SASS) were used on the front end. Pug is used to cleanup the code.

Each user is given full CRUD abilities over every post (even those that they did not initially create).  Each post has a title, body, and Soundcloud src field. A post can be created filling out without providing a Soundcloud src. However, completing the title and body form fields is requirement for actually submitting a post. Again, this is a community (and not just simply random users). So it goes without saying that these individuals are all held to a particular level of trust.
